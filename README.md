Custom-complete uses [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/). 
This project is a custom auto-complete form. Each time the user types information, the form sends a GET request to the NodeJS server, which responds with a list of alternativles for the form to show. This form caches results as well and was created based on the (non-working) custom example present in: 

 - https://material.angularjs.org/HEAD/demo/autocomplete

For the icons I used the following documentation, whihch I highly recommend:

 - https://klarsys.github.io/angular-material-icons/



For more information see the oficial documentation.

Notes: To run the exmaple, make sure the server is running first !
